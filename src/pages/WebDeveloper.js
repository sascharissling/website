      <h3>Web Development</h3>
      <p>
        In late 2019 I began my journey in Web Development with one of the first
        bootcamps of its kind in germany at{" "}
        <span>
          <a
            href="https://neuefische.de"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            neue fische
          </a>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        This bootcamp enabled me to open a floodgate of a part of my brain I had
        never accessed before.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love building intuitive, modern and beautiful front-end applications
        in <span>React.js</span>. For projects and code please go ahead and
        visit my well-organized GitHub page just below this text. All my
        meaningful projects have detailed screenshots or deployments on zeit.co
        going with them.
      </p>
    </WebDevelopment>
